# 🏠 Homelab Repository

Welcome to my **Homelab repository** — a personal space for documenting, planning, and automating my self-hosted infrastructure. This repository is where I collect ideas, write down architectural decisions, and store scripts that help power and maintain my Homelab.

## 📘 About This Repo

This project is a work-in-progress reflection of my journey into building a reliable, secure, and efficient Homelab. Whether it’s hosting services, managing backups, experimenting with new technologies, or creating automation workflows — everything lives here.

Feel free to explore or get inspired!
